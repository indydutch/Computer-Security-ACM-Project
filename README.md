### **Description:** Computer Security Access Control Matrix Project Code for Senior Design at Florida Polytechnic University. 

#### **Code Organization:** 

- Main.java: driver for the program. Contains onMessageReceived() which constantly checks for a command and creates a corresponding object then calls a function with any input parameters.

- AddHere.java: add here.
  

#### **Code Building:** 

- build.gradle: please ensure that your build.gradle file has all the necessary dependencies that are required for the database.
- ADDHERE (Discord bot API): used for running the bot on a Discord server.

Before running the code, add the bot token "ODA0NzY4MTM3MzMyMzkxOTQ4.YBRIuw.QYiFCgQJdnngsWP2J7Ne6Jll1PA"  to the "Program Requirements" text box in the "Edit Configurations" for the "Main" program file. **<u>*CRITICAL*</u>**



#### **Team Contributions:**

Note: all team members worked and contributed as equally as possible with coding and researching for what we needed for this project. For formality's sake, here is a list of team members and what we are each contributing:

- Matthew Dutchess: Java Programming, Team Management, SQLite Database Management, QA Testing.

- Calvin Hariprasad: Java Programming, QA Testing, Timeline Organization.

  

#### **Imported Libraries:** 

- DV8FromTheWorld JDA: used for basic bot functions such as creating any intents and detecting any messages or users within a Discord.
- ADDHERE: for handling any login exceptions.
